				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
				<h2>About Myself</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Benjamin Reding and I was born in Luxembourg.
					<br>
					Born in 1999 so I am fortunate enough to have grown up alongside the gaming industry.
					<br>
					I have been playing games since the time of the gamecube and have played countless games since then.
					<br>
					Very proactive in keeping up-to-date with the latest and greatest in the industry.
					<br>
					I am a strong creative and a hard worker.
					<br>
					My interest for gaming and the industry surrounding it has always been my favorite.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>My History</h2>
				<p>
					I was born and raised in Luxembourg where I spent my first 20 Years.
					<br>
					At 17 I was moving between schools trying to find the right course
					for games programming, but unfortunately at this time, there were no such courses, but I
					still spent a good 4 years picking up skills and learning regardless.
					<br>
					Since there were no courses, I looked beyond the borders and went to college
					in the UK where I studied Games development for 3 years.
					<br>
					I then moved to the Netherlands to study Creative Media & Games Technology at a University Bachelor level.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>My Future</h2>
				<p>
					In my future, I aim to either start my own studio, or lead a team
					that continues to innovate and bring experiences that focus on the user first.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>My Passion</h2>
				<p>
					It is very important to me that a game feels good to play.
					<br>
					I am extremely passionate about what I do.
					<br>
					I take great care and put in extra effort in every project I am a part of.
					<br>
					I aim to bring a pleasant and satisfying feel alongside a polished experience 
					to everything I make.
					<br>
