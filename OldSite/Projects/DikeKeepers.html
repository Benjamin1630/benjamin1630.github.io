			<h1>Dike Keepers (Unity) (Uni Project)</h1>
			<h2>My Role</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				I was designated Lead Programmer for this project, because I was the only one who knew how to write any code.
				I learned a lot while working on this project and I learned quickly.
				Within 2 months I went from writing basic movement to implementing complex and dynamic mechanics for the enemy AI and player UX.

				The game ended up being an FPS with a spin on the zombies formula.
				Made entirely within Unity, the game uses momentum based movement for satisfying and responsive gameplay.
				The enemy AI is managed by a script that tracks everything from where the can spawn to how the enemy behaves.
				To stop the player from just sitting in one spot the enemy manager chooses a couple random points every so often
				and directs the enemies to attack those points, which the player needs to protect.
				<br><br>
				The player is given a number of tools which can be upgraded and exchanged for caught muskrats, which are the enemy in the game.
				<br><br>
				(The in-game art and 3D models were made by my team members.)
