				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
				<h2>My History</h2>
				<p>
					I was born and raised in Luxembourg where I spent my first 20 Years.
					<br><br>
					Most of my late teens were spent moving between schools trying to find the right course
					for games programming, but unfortunately at this time, there were no such courses, but I 
					still spent a good 4 years picking up skills and learning regardless.
					<br><br>
					Since there were no courses, I looked beyond the borders and went to college 
					in the UK where I studied for 3 years.
					<br><br>
					I then moved to the Netherlands to study at a University level.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>My Future</h2>
				<p>
					In my future, I aim to either start my own studio, or join a team 
					that continues to innovate and focus on the user first.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>My Passion</h2>
				<p>
					I aim to bring a pleasent and satisfying feel alongside a polished experience 
					to everything I make.
					<br>
					It is very important to me that a game feels good to play.
